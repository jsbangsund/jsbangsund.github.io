 abstract = {Self-organizing patterns with micrometre-scale features are promising for the large-area fabrication of photonic devices and scattering layers in optoelectronics. Pattern formation would ideally occur in the active semiconductor to avoid the need for further processing steps. Here, we report an approach to form periodic patterns in single layers of organic semiconductors by a simple annealing process. When heated, a crystallization front propagates across the film, producing a sinusoidal surface structure with wavelengths comparable to that of near-infrared light. These surface features initially form in the amorphous region within a micrometre of the crystal growth front, probably due to competition between crystal growth and surface mass transport. The pattern wavelength can be tuned from 800 nm to 2,400 nm by varying the film thickness and annealing temperature, and millimetre-scale domain sizes are obtained. This phenomenon could be exploited for the self-assembly of microstructured organic optoelectronic devices.},
