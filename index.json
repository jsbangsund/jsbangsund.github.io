When heated, a crystallization front propagates across the film, producing a sinusoidal surface structure with wavelengths comparable to that of near-infrared light. These surface features initially form in the amorphous region within a micrometer of the crystal growth front, probably due to competition between crystal growth and surface mass transport. We demonstrate control over these patterns by varying processing conditions and substrate properties. This phenomenon could be exploited for the self-assembly of microstructured organic optoelectronic devices.","tags":null,"title":"Formation of aligned periodic patterns during the crystallization of organic semiconductor thin films","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S.

Unlike conventional mixed-host OLEDs that combine hole- and electron-transporting hosts, charge transport in this device occurs primarily along the ambipolar host and the emitter, while the wide energy gap host serves to modify the charge injection and transport characteristics of the emissive layer. This approach allows both the width and position of the exciton recombination zone to be tuned without introducing exciplex states. Whereas overall device stability improves with increasing recombination zone width in conventional mixed-host OLEDs, mixing in this system reduces the recombination zone extent yet still increases device lifetime. By decoupling luminance losses into the photostability of the emitter and the exciton formation efficiency, we show that this enhancement arises from a trade-off between bulk and interfacial degradation. The addition of the wide energy gap host moves the recombination zone away from the interface between the hole-transport layer and the emissive layer, sacrificing a modest increase in bulk degradation to substantially reduce interfacial degradation. We find that the lifetime can be improved by 50% by balancing these competing degradation pathways.","tags":null,"title":"Improved stability in organic light-emitting devices by mixing ambipolar and wide energy gap hosts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John S.

In this work, we demonstrate novel phenyl borate and carborane-based anions paired with a near-infrared (NIR)-selective heptamethine cation. We further explore the effects of anion structures and functional groups on both device performance and physical properties. Changing the functional groups on the anion significantly alters the open circuit voltage and yields a clear dependence on electron withdrawing groups. Anion exchange is also shown to selectively alter the solubility and film surface energy of the resulting molecular salt, enabling the potential fabrication of solution-deposited cascade or multi-junction devices from orthogonal solvents.

To develop a more complete understanding of degradation, additional specific data are needed as a function of luminance loss. The overall degradation in luminance during testing can be decoupled into a loss in emitter photoluminescence efficiency and a reduction in the exciton formation efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a method that permits separation of these component efficiencies, yielding the time evolution of two additional specific device parameters that can be used in interpreting and modeling degradation without modification to the device architecture or introduction of any additional post-degradation characterization steps. Here, devices based on the phosphor tris[2-phenylpyridinato-C2,N]iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3) are characterized as a function of initial luminance and emissive layer thickness. The overall loss in device luminance is found to originate primarily from a reduction in the exciton formation efficiency which is exacerbated in devices with thinner emissive layers. Interestingly, the contribution to overall degradation from a reduction in the efficiency of exciton recombination (i.e., photoluminescence) is unaffected by thickness, suggesting a fixed exciton recombination zone width and degradation at an interface.","tags":null,"title":"Decoupling degradation in exciton formation and recombination during lifetime testing of organic light-emitting devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Margaret Young","John Suddard-Bangsund","Tyler J.

Extending photoresponse deeper into the NIR is a significant challenge facing small molecule organic photovoltaics, and recent demonstrations have been limited by open-circuit voltages much lower than the theoretical and practical limits. This work presents molecular design strategies that enable facile tuning of energy level alignment and open-circuit voltages in organic salt-based photovoltaics. Anions are also shown to have a strong influence on exciton diffusion length. These insights provide a clear route toward achieving high efficiency transparent and panchromatic photovoltaics, and open up design opportunities to rapidly tailor molecules for new donor–acceptor systems.","tags":["energy level tuning","near-infrared solar harvesting","open-circuit voltage","organic salts","transparent solar cells"],"title":"Organic Salts as a Route to Energy Level Control in Low Bandgap, High Open-Circuit Voltage Organic and Transparent Solar Cells that Approach the Excitonic Voltage Limit","type":"publication"}]
